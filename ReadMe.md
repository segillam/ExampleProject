# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation to create this website was to practice the basic web-development skills that I have developed prior to officially starting my bootcamp. It serves as a benchmark demonstration of my skills as well as a vessel to hold my notes that I can easily refer back to as my skills progress. I learned introductory coding techniques as well as how to add different elements of a project together.
